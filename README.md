# 🍕 Food Delivery Route Optimization Using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates a simple food delivery **route optimization system** using graph theory. By modeling delivery routes as a weighted graph, the system finds the **shortest and most efficient path** from restaurants to users using **Dijkstra’s algorithm**. It visually simulates deliveries on an interactive map interface built with React.
